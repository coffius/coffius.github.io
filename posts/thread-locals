**DISCLAIMER:** Do not use it in Scala!  
There are much better, safer, simpler ways of passing a context in Scala apart from using `ThreadLocal`.

## Idea and Example
The idea behind using `ThreadLocal` for passing a context is next:
* Define a static field `context: ThreadLocal[Context]` somewhere
* Incapculate logic execution into a separate thread
* Initialise the context with its value inside the thread
* Use the field to get information about the context
